            Sass is essentially an extension of CSS which adds in lots of cool
            features which are not available in vanilla CSS. With Sass we can
            write CSS code in a cleaner, more organised format and then compile
            the code straight into CSS code which can then be read by our html
            file.
          </p>
          <p class="main-p main-p2">
            Sass allows us to use features such as mixins, imports, nesting,
            variables, operators, and other logical features of programming
            languages such as functions and loops. This means we can write
            large-scale projects more easily without needing to repeat ourselves
            and make our code more organised and easier for others to read.

        <article>
          <h2 class="article-title">How do we write Sass?</h2>
          <p class="article-text">
            Sass is a preprocessor which means that we first write our styles in
            a .scss file and then use a compiler such as a text editor extension
            to convert the scss code into a normal css stylesheet, ready to be
            accessed by our html file and rendered by the browser.
          </p>
          <h3 class="variables-title">Variables:</h3>
          <p>
            Variables allow us to store property values inside which can be
            reused throughout our code. This saves us needing to repeatedly type
            out frquently used property values such as color or font sizes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Variables also allow us to have a single source location for the
            property value which we can edit in just one place, the values will
            then be changed for all the elements using this variable in the rest
            of the page. This helps to make our code easier to read, more
            efficient to write, and easier to edit and make changes to our
            existing code.
          </p>

          <p>
            We can declare a variable by using the '$' symbol and then assigning
            our variable a name e.g. '$fontSize: 20px;'. Now whenever we assign
            an element with 'font-size: $fontSize;', it will always be 20px
            unless we change the value of the variable at it's source.
          </p>
          <h3 class="mixins-title">Mixins:</h3>
          <p>
            Mixins are another feature of Sass which allows us to reuse blocks
            of our code to help speed up writing our code and also keeping it
            DRY.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mixins work in a similar way to how functions work in most
            programming languages. We first declare a mixin using @mixin and
            then assign it a name e.g. mixinName and then assign the mixin a set
            of parameters as placeholders in which arguments may be passed
            through. Inside the curly brackets '{ }' of the mixin we can then
            include any properties and their values which we want to reuse.
          </p>
          <p>
            To use our saved block of code. Within the desired selector, we just
            need to use @include mixinName() and then any arguments we wish to
            pass through. The selector will then take on all of the saved
            properties in our mixin!
          </p>

          <h3 class="imports-title">Modules & Imports:</h3>

          <p>
            When we are working on large projects, it is common for us to have
            often very long stylesheets which can become difficult to read an
            keep track of. With Sass, we can modulate our code by breaking the
            stylesheet into smaller sections and importing them onto our main
            stylesheet from other files.
          </p>

          <p>
            All we need to do is move our code into a new stylesheet and then
            use @import on our main stylesheet and then link the file path of
            the of the newly created stylesheet. This allows our main stylesheet
            to locate where the new stylesheet is which contains our code, which
            then allows is to be compiled into our CSS stylesheet and rendered
            through our html file.
          </p>

          <h3 class="nesting-title">Nesting:</h3>
          <p>
            Nesting allows us to structure our CSS code in a similar format to
            our html code. This makes it much easier to read our code and also
            allows us to see the parent/child relationships between the elements
            in which we are styling more easily.
          </p>

          <h3 class="extensions-title">Extensions & Inheritance:</h3>
          <p>
            Extensions work in a simlar way to mixins. They allow us to use an
            element's properties and then allows us to extend those properties
            to another element of our choosing which will then inherit those
            properties.
          </p>

          <p>
            Inside the element we want to change, we merely use the @extend
            command, along with the selector for the specific element we want to
          </p>

          <h3 class="operator-title">Operators:</h3>
          <p>
            Another cool feature which allows us to use programming techniques
            in our CSS code is the use of operators. We can use mathemtical
            operators such as '+', '-', '/', '*', or we can use logical
            operators such as '&' to perform calculations with our CSS code.
